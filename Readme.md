# R2DT

**Version 2.0 (2024)**

**[See the R2DT documentation](https://r2dt.readthedocs.io/)** or read the [latest preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.29.611006v1).

The [R2DT software](https://github.com/r2dt-bio/R2DT) automatically generates [RNA secondary structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_secondary_structure) diagrams in consistent, reproducible and recongnisable layouts using a library of templates representing a wide range of RNAs.

## Examples

The following example visualisations show LSU, SSU, and 5S rRNA, four tRNAs, two RNAse P, snoRNA, MoCo riboswitch, and U4 snRNA:

## Getting started

R2DT can be used in a number of ways:

* [Web application](https://rnacentral.org/r2dt) hosted by RNAcentral
* [API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/common/tools/help/index.html?tool=r2dt) powered by EMBL-EBI Web Services
* As a command line tool with [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/#singularity), or in a bare metal installation
