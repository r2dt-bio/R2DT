In eukaryotes, it is synthesised by RNA polymerase III (the other eukaryotic rRNAs are cleaved from a 45S precursor synthesised by RNA polymerase I). In Xenopus oocytes, it has been shown that fingers 4-7 of the nine-zinc finger transcription factor TFIIIA can bind to the central region of 5S RNA. Thus, in addition to positively regulating 5S rRNA transcription, TFIIIA also stabilises 5S rRNA until it is required for transcription.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 24.99 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	712	139932	0	0	Gene; rRNA;	Published; PMID:11283358	8022	0	\N		0.59496	-5.32219	1600000	213632	305	119	1	-3.78120	0.71822	2013-10-03 20:41:44	2019-01-04 15:01:52

Its 5' end forms complementary base pairs with the 5' splice junction, thus defining the 5' donor site of an intron. There are significant differences in sequence and secondary structure between metazoan and yeast U1 snRNAs, the latter being much longer (568 nucleotides as compared to 164 nucleotides in human). Nevertheless, secondary structure predictions suggest that all U1 snRNAs share a 'common core' consisting of helices I, II, the proximal region of III, and IV [1]. This family does not contain the larger yeast sequences. The structure of U1 spliceosomal RNA has been reported in [5,6]. It present 4 Stem loops (SL1, SL2, SL3, and SL4) and a region call Helix H. SL1, SL2, and SL3 are join for the Helix H, forming a four-helix junction that are separated of SL4. U1 snRNA is important in the precatalytic spliceosome, where the 5' splice site (5'SS) of the pre-mRNA is recognized by pairing with 5'-U1 snRNA. Where spliceosome activation is initiated by a disruption of the 5′SS–U1 snRNP interaction by the DEAD-box helicase Prp28 [6].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 30.00 -Z 742849.287494 CM SEQDB	100	11452	0	0	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	Published; PMID:2405391	516	0	\N		0.67253	-8.56427	1600000	409669	267	166	1	-3.77470	0.71617	2013-10-03 20:57:11	2021-03-01 19:41:32

There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localisation, stability and hyper-methylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	87	3924	0	0	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Published; PMID:19875933; Gardner PP	416	0	\N		0.59795	-9.77278	1600000	400072	326	218	1	-3.83010	0.71077	2013-10-03 22:04:54	2019-01-04 15:01:52

It consists of 184 nucleotides that fold into an extended hairpin structure with a large single-stranded internal bulge. The 6S RNA specifically associates with RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the sigma70 specificity factor. This interaction represses expression from a sigma70-dependent promoter during stationary phase [1]. 6S RNA homologs have recently been identified in most bacterial genomes [2,3]. Many Gram-positive species have two copies of 6S RNA. In Bacillus subtilis, both copies appear to interact with RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the housekeeping sigma factor and be expressed during different stages of growth. In many proteobacteria, 6S RNA may be processed from a transcript encoding homologs of the E. coli YgfA protein which is a putative 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase activity.

These two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS translation but not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop is essential for antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation. The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is complementary with the upstream leader portion of RpoS messenger RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the RpoS message might be important for translational regulation.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	5	35	0	0	Gene; sRNA;	Published; PMID:9770508	39	0	\N		0.53383	-8.38474	1600000	350673	177	85	1	-3.35620	0.71888	2013-02-01 11:56:19	2019-01-04 15:01:52

It is involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, as represented by this family. Eight helical elements fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region [1,2]. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP [1]. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54 M domain mediates signal sequence recognition [2,3]. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilises helix 8 for SRP54 binding [1]. The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) [4] provides compilations of SRP components, with phylogenetic data and structural illustrations. Many sequences below the threshold for this family are clearly closely related, but are most likely to be SRP RNA derived pseudogenes. The human genome in particular is known to contain a large amount of SRP RNA related sequence, including Alu repeats. While the threshold of this family is set high so as to minimise the number of hits to such regions, it is likely that some remain.

The Csr regulatory system has a strong negative regulatory effect on glycogen biosynthesis, glyconeogenesis and glycogen catabolism and a positive regulatory effect on glycolysis [1]. In other bacteria such as Erwinia caratovara the RsmA protein has been shown to regulate the production of virulence determinants, such extracellular enzymes [2]. RsmA binds to RsmB regulatory RNA which is also a member of this family [2]. RsmB RNA was shown to be upregulated by GacS/A system, and increase downstream T3SS gene expression.[6] FlhDC, the master regulator of flagellar genes, also activates rsmB RNA production.[7] A regulatory network have been revealed connecting rsmB, FlhDC and T3SS.[8] Plays role in the biocontrol activity of Rahnella aquatilis HX2 (a biocontrol agent producing antibacterial substance).[5]	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	38	254	0	0	Gene; sRNA;	Predicted; PFOLD; Bateman A; Gardner PP;	196	0	\N		0.69326	-9.81172	1600000	546392	555	356	1	-4.06520	0.70388	2013-10-03 23:07:27	2019-01-04 15:01:52

Its role is to liberate the mRNA from a stalled ribosome. To accomplish this part of the tmRNA is used as a reading frame that ends in a translation stop signal. The broken mRNA is replaced in the ribosome by the tmRNA and translation of the tmRNA leads to addition of a proteolysis tag to the incomplete protein enabling recognition by a protease.

Both miRNAs let-7 and mir-98 have now been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide range of species (MIPF:MIPF000002). miRNAs are transcribed as ~70nt precursors (modelled here) and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22nt product. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. The involvement of Dicer in miRNA processing suggests a relationship with the phenomenon of RNA interference.

The packaging of DNA into the procapsid requires a molecular motor which using ATP as energy to accomplish the energetically unfavourable motion. In some bacteriophage, an RNA (pRNA) molecule is a vital component of this motor [1]. Structural analyses of the packaging motor have demonstrated that the pRNA molecule has fivefold symmetry when attached to the prohead [2-4]. The pRNA is thought to be bound by the capsid connector protein (PFAM:PF05352) [4]. Only the first 120 bases of the pRNA are essential for packing the viral DNA [5,6]. The pRNA is proposed to be comprised of two domains, one corresponding to the first 120 bases and the second to the remaining 50 bases [6]. Nuclear cleavage occurs in the single strand region linking these two domains [6].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	3	2	0	0	Gene;	Predicted; ILM	3	0	\N		0.67619	-8.85020	1600000	385188	387	244	1	-3.78590	0.70874	2013-10-03 23:21:21	2019-01-04 15:01:52

The ribosome can only bind the capped mRNA after binding the initiator tRNA. Translation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) mRNA is initiated by a different mechanism from the usual 5' cap-binding model [2]. This alternate mechanism relies on the direct binding of the 40S ribosomal subunit by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5' UTR of HCV RNA. HCV IRES adopts a complex structure, and may differ significantly from IRES elements identified in picornaviruses. A small number of eukaryotic mRNA have been shown to be translated by internal ribosome entry [3].

RF00084	CsrC	1378	CsrC RNA family	Bateman A	Bateman A	61.00	64.70	58.40	The 245 nucleotide sRNA of Escherichia coli, CsrC, was discovered using a genetic screen for factors that regulate glycogen biosynthesis. CsrC RNA binds multiple copies of CsrA Pfam:PF02599, a protein that post-transcriptionally regulates central carbon flux, biofilm formation and motility in E. coli. CsrC antagonises the regulatory effects of CsrA, presumably by sequestering this protein. The discovery of CsrC is intriguing, in that a similar sRNA, CsrB, performs essentially the same function. Both sRNAs possess similar imperfect repeat sequences (18 in CsrB, nine in CsrC), primarily localised in the loops of predicted hairpins, which may serve as CsrA binding elements. Transcription of csrC increases as the culture approaches the stationary phase of growth and is indirectly activated by CsrA via the response regulator UvrY [1]. This RNA was also discovered in E. coli during a large scale screen [2]. The gene called SraK, was highly abundant in stationary phase, but low levels could be detected in exponentially growing cells as well [2].

RF00106	RNAI	1399	RNAI	Griffiths-Jones SR	Griffiths-Jones SR	47.00	47.00	46.90	RNAI is an antisense repressor of the replication of some E. coli plasmids, including ColE1. Plasmid replication is usually initiated by RNAII, which acts as a primer by binding to its template DNA. The complementary RNAI binds RNAII prohibiting it from its initiation role. The rate of degradation of RNAI is therefore a major factor in control of plasmid replication. This rate of degradation is aided by the pcnB (plasmid copy number B) gene product, which polyadenylates the 3' end of RNAI targeting it for degradation by PNPase. Please note: This family contains subsequences annotated as human (Z96734), Arabidopsis (AB003142), Xenopus (X91243) and S. pombe (L25927, L25928), which match with highly significant scores.

Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most bacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) have a longer eukaryote-like SRP RNA that includes an Alu domain [2]. The Alu domain of the longer SRP RNAs is not included in this model and therefore the reported bounds of some members are incorrect.

The GAIT element is involved in selective translational silencing of the Cp transcript. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a multifunctional, copper-containing glycoprotein produced by the liver and secreted into the plasma. As an acute-phase protein, its plasma concentration can double during multiple inflammatory conditions. Plasma Cp has been reported to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis, carotid restenosis after endarterectomy, and myocardial infarction. Translational silencing of Cp, and possibly other transcripts, mediated by the GAIT element may contribute to the resolution of the local inflammatory response following cytokine activation of macrophages [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	8	32	0	0	Cis-reg;	Published; PMID:12588972	27	0	\N		0.62086	-3.07584	1600000	277816	160	71	1	-3.43170	0.71895	2013-10-04 00:09:50	2019-01-04 15:01:52

REN-SRE is thought to destabilise the mRNA, promoting degradation of the sequence. It has been found that a number of proteins bind to the REN-SRE to stabilise the mRNA and promote translation. Renin is secreted by renal juxtaglomerular cells and catalyses the conversion of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I which is the rate-limiting step in the production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II induces hypertension and REN therefore requires tight control to ensure expression appropriate to need [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	13	36	0	0	Cis-reg;	Published; PMID:12933794	33	0	\N		0.67193	-7.73983	1600000	794799	102	37	1	-3.75150	0.72007	2013-10-04 00:10:02	2019-01-04 15:01:52

G-CSF is secreted by fibroblasts and endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor alpha and by activated macrophages. The synthesis of G-CSF is regulated both transcriptionally and through control of mRNA stability. In unstimulated cells G-CSF mRNA is unstable but becomes stabilised in response to IL-1 or tumour necrosis factor alpha, and also in the case of monocytes and macrophages, in response to lipopolysaccharide. It is likely that the presence of the SLDE in the G-CSF mRNA contributes to the specificity of regulation of G-CSF mRNA and enhances the rate of shortening of the poly(A) tail [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	16	37	0	0	Cis-reg;	Published; PMID:11865046	40	0	\N		0.54365	-7.72831	1600000	282580	189	96	1	-3.21690	0.71864	2013-10-04 00:10:24	2019-01-04 15:01:52

When first expressed in early embryogenesis, fushi tarazu mRNA is uniformly distributed over most of the embryo. Subsequently, fushi tarazu mRNA expression rapidly evolves into a pattern of seven stripes that encircle the embryo. The instability of fushi tarazu mRNA is probably crucial for attaining this localised pattern of expression [1]. Experiments provide evidence for at least two destabilising elements in the fushi tarazu mRNA, one located within the 5' one-third of the mRNA and the other near the 3' end (termed FIE3 for ftz instability element 3'). The FIE3 lies within a 201-nucleotide sequence just upstream of the polyadenylation signal and can act autonomously to destabilise a heterologous mRNA. Further deletion constructs identified an essential 68-nucleotide element within the FIE3 [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	5	8	0	0	Cis-reg;	Predicted; stemloc, Bateman A	11	0	\N		0.46445	-7.35881	1600000	385132	253	65	1	-3.45660	0.71953	2013-10-04 00:20:33	2019-01-04 15:01:52

This C/D box domain U91 (also known as U4-8) was identified by Darzacq and is predicted to guide the 2'O-ribose methylation of U4 snRNA C8 [1]. This C/D domain was later found associated in tandem with another C/D box domain U12-22 (RFAM:RF00492). Both the doublet (U12-22/U4-8) and singlet (U4-8) forms of this snRNA have been purified from Hela cells [1]. The doublet form U12-22/U4-8 has been shown to localise to the nucleoplasm and is proposed to reside in the Cajal bodies whereas the U4-8 single domain appears to accumulate in the nucleolus [3]. In humans the genomic location of U12-88/U4-8 is intergenic and the purified transcript has been shown to possess a methylated guanosine cap suggesting it is independently transcribed by RNA pol II [3].

Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5'-ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5'-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous -- helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	70	303	0	0	Gene; ribozyme;	Published; PMID:9847214	340	0	\N		0.69973	-9.74148	1600000	423094	968	303	1	-4.35440	0.70576	2013-10-04 00:36:13	2019-01-04 15:01:52

Antizyme genes have have two partially overlapping open reading frames, the second, which encodes the functional protein requires +1 translational frameshifting. This frameshift is stimulated by a pseudoknot present 3' of the frameshift site in the antizyme mRNA. The frameshifting efficiency is dependent on the level of polyamines in the cell, when the polyamine concentration is high frameshifting is more likely to occur which leads to an increase in the quantity of functional antizyme produced. The functional antizyme acts to reduce ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity which leads to a drop in polyamines present in the cell. Therefore, this family can be thought of as a biosensor for intracellular free polyamines [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 21 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	13	280	0	0	Cis-reg; frameshift_element;	Published; PMID:15147837	114	0	\N		0.66203	-4.23694	1600000	362460	137	59	1	-3.38040	0.71923	2013-10-04 00:37:38	2019-01-04 15:01:52

RF00492	SCARNA17	1744	small Cajal body-specific RNA 17	Moxon SJ, Daub J	Moxon SJ	75.00	76.30	74.70	scaRNAs are a specific class of small nuclear RNAs which localise to the Cajal bodies and guide the modification of RNA polymerase II transcribed spliceosomal RNAs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U12 [1]. The complete human U12-22/U4-8 scaRNA is composed of two tandem C/D box domains (termed U12-22 and U4-8). The 5' and 3' C/D domains are predicted to guide the 2'O-ribose methylation of residue U22 in U12 (RFAM:RF00007) and residue C8 in U4 (RFAM:RF00015) snRNAs respectively [1]. This family only includes only the 5' C/D box domain (U12-22) as the 3' C/D box is represented by RFAM:RF00283. The 3' C/D domain (U4-8) was also cloned previously by Darzacq [2] and called U91. Both the doublet (U12-22/U4-8) and singlet (U4-8) forms of this snRNA have been purified from Hela cells [1]. The doublet form U12-22/U4-8 has been shown to localise to the nucleoplasm and is proposed to reside in the Cajal bodies whereas the U4-8 single domain appears to accumulate in the nucleolus [1]. In humans the genomic location of U12-88/U4-8 is intergenic and the purified transcript has been shown to possess a methylated guanosine cap suggesting it is independently transcribed by RNA pol II [1].	snoU12-22	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	6	70	0	0	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; scaRNA;	Published;PMID:15556860	36	0	\N		0.57665	-5.83962	1600000	243360	257	144	1	-3.40780	0.71819	2013-10-04 00:50:42	2019-01-04 15:01:52

The aptamers cooperatively bind glycine to regulate the expression of downstream genes. In Bacillus subtilis, this riboswitch is found upstream of the gcvT operon which controls glycine degradation. It is thought that when glycine is in excess it will bind to both aptamers to activate these genes and facilitate glycine degradation [1]. In vivo experiments demonstrated that glycine does not need to bind both aptamers for regulation. Mutation to the first aptamer caused greatest reduction in downstream gene expression, while mutation to the second one had varying effects. Glycine-induced expression of the gcvT operon is needed for B. subtilise growth, swarming motility and biofilm formation (in high glycine enviroment).[2]	gcvT	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 30.00 -Z 742849.287494 CM SEQDB	44	4577	0	0	Cis-reg; riboswitch;	Predicted; Barrick JE, Breaker RR	3010	0	\N		0.60968	-3.97297	1600000	143931	359	94	1	-4.01510	0.71854	2013-10-04 00:51:40	2020-09-14 14:04:27

[1] Other non-coding RNAs uncovered in the same analysis include: speF, ybhL, metA, and serC. [1]Several studies inSinorhizobium meliloti showed that suhB element is indeed a non-coding RNA:firstly it was detected on Northern blot and called Sm8RNA[2], secondly in an RNAseq study referred to as SmelC689.[3]The mutant phenotype's (strain lacking the small RNA) cytoplasm contains higher content of polyhydroxybutyrate (PBH)storage granules than wild type strain. The sRNA is required to limit the PBH intracellular accumulation when the nitrogen-fixing Sinorhizobium meliloti is under condition of surplus carbon in relation to nitrogen. It has been renamed to mmgR. Further study confirmed that mmgR fine-tunes the regulation of PBH storage.[4]Northern blot confirmed the expression of the sRNA in other rhizobia species. MmgR homologues were found in most alpha-proteobacteria. The Rho-independent terminator and a single stranded region 10-mer (UUUCCUCCCU)are completely conserved. Hence, it was proposed to define a new family of alpha-proteobacterial sRNA: alpha-r8 of which mmgR is a member.[5] RNA binding protein Hfq is binding and stabilising mmgR.[6][7] Expression of the mmgR gene was shown to be controlled by nitrogen (N).[8] Further study[9] has shown that the regulatory proteins NtrC may be required for expression of mmgR gene upon N limitation. Under carbon (C) limitation, mmgR transcription is repressed by AntiA.[9]	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 19.00 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	87	940	0	0	Gene; sRNA;	Predicted; Barrick JE	501	0	\N		0.59829	-6.72824	1600000	268107	140	77	1	-3.39270	0.71873	2013-10-04 00:53:19	2019-01-04 15:01:52

However, neither the stability nor the activity of LhrC is depending on the presence of Hfq[2][3]. LhrC is transcribed from the intergenic region between the protein coding genes cysK, a putative cysteine synthase and sul, a putative dihydropteroate synthase [1]. In Listeria monocytogenes four additional copies of lhrC have been identifed in the genome, three of which are located in tandem repeat upstream of the originally characterised lhrC [1]. This RNA molecule appears to be conserved amongst Listeria species but has not been identified in other bacterial species. The direct mRNA targets of LhrC are the virulence adhesion LapB, and the oligo-peptide binding protein OppA. The 3 conserved UCCC motifs common to all copies of LhrC are involved in the mRNA binding and post-transcriptional repression of the target genes. Interestingly, 2 other Listerina monocytogenes sRNAs Rli22 and Rli33 contain two UCCC motifs and use them to repress oppA mRNA expression.[4]	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	12	16	0	0	Gene; sRNA;	Published; PMID:16682563	12	0	\N		0.47780	-8.02974	1600000	382984	214	111	1	-3.10690	0.71833	2013-10-04 01:04:25	2019-01-04 15:01:52
RF00617	cHP	1262	flavivirus capsid hairpin cHP	Daub J	PMID:16474125	40.00	40.20	39.90	cHP is a conserved RNA hairpin structure identified within the capsid coding region of several flavivirus genomes. These positive strand RNA genomes are translated as a single polypeptide and subsequently cleaved into constituent proteins, the first of which is the capsid protein. The cHP hairpin is located within the capsid coding region between two AUG start codons. The cHP cis element has been shown to direct translation start from the thermodynamically unstable first start codon [1]. The ability of cHP to direct initiation from the first start codon is proportional to its thermodynamic stability, is position dependent, and is sequence independent [1]. It has been demonstrated that both AUGs and the conserved cHP are necessary for efficient viral replication in human and mosquito cells [1].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	59	2	0	0	Cis-reg;	Published; PMID:16474125	13	0	\N		0.58640	-8.40679	1600000	743570	104	45	1	-3.64070	0.71938	2013-02-01 11:57:56	2019-01-04 15:01:52

Meyers et al. 2008 [1] confirm that preQ1-II recognise the queuosine (Q) precursor pre-queuosine 1 (preQ1). Q is a hyper modified nucleoside present in some anticodons in tRNAs (Try, Asn, Asp and His). The structure of preQ1-II riboswitch has been reported by Kang et al. 2014 [3], as preQ1 riboswitch (RF00522) preQ1-II structure present an unusual H-type pseudoknot featuring and differs in the interactions that recognise preQ1.

They form type I toxin/antitoxin system that includes an mRNA encoding for a short, toxic peptide (bsrE, bsrG and bsrH) and an antitoxin that is comprised of an antisense RNA.[7] bsrG encodes a 39-amino-acid toxin, and the 180 nucleotide antisense sRNA called SR4 acts as the antitoxin (they overlap by 123 nucleotides). SR4 interaction with the 3'UTR of bsrG RNA promotes bsrG degradation and inhibits its translation.[2][4] BsrG interferes with cell envelope biosynthesis, causes membrane invaginations and delocalisation of the cell wall synthesis and initiates autolysis.[3] bsrE RNA encodes 30 amino-acid toxin peptide. Its antitoxin gene, SR5 overlaps by 112 nucleotides at the 3' end of bsrE.[5] SR5 also overlaps bsrG from nucleotide 163 to 52 (Rfam overlap check). The antitoxin SR5 promotes bsrE degradation but unlike SR4 it does not directly inhibits toxin mRNA translation.[5][6]	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	6	295	0	0	Gene; sRNA;	Predicted; WAR	166	0	\N		0.62771	-8.93185	1600000	368026	479	259	1	-3.99710	0.70797	2013-10-04 02:33:19	2019-01-04 15:01:52

Avesson et al. 2011 [3] report that Class I RNA present a down regulation during the development of social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, they also found that deletion of one of the Class I RNAs, DdR-21, results in aberrant development.

In MarS deletion strains expression of mga and several Mga-activated genes is reduced. This down-regulation of virulence factors leads to increased susceptibility of the deletion strain to phagocytosis, reduced adherence to human keratinocytes. However, the lack of MarS increased bacterial dissemination and tolerance towards oxidative stress.[2] Called SR914400 in [3].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	31	55	0	0	Gene; sRNA;	Published; PMID:20230605;	78	0	\N		0.54436	-9.09290	1600000	338303	295	143	1	-3.60200	0.71807	2013-10-04 02:47:40	2019-01-04 15:01:52

RF01763	ykkC-III	1701	Guanidine-III riboswitch	Weinberg Z	Published; PMID:20230605;	37.00	37.40	34.80	Although the structure of ykkC-III RNAs does not resemble ykkC/yxkD RNAs, both have a structure complexity that led to the proposal that they represent riboswitches. The ykkC-III motif has a rigidly conserved ACGA sequence within it that resembles a less rigidly conserved ACGA or ACGG sequence found in mini-ykkC RNAs, but it is unknown whether this observation relates to a biological relationship. Biochemical validation has been presented to show that this motif is a third class of guanidine riboswitches.[2]	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	39	626	0	0	Cis-reg;	Published; PMID:20230605;	613	0	\N		0.55112	-8.81258	1600000	301790	135	67	1	-4.35780	0.71900	2013-10-04 02:48:55	2019-01-04 15:01:52

The ROSE element is a negative regulator of heat shock gene expression. The secondary structure is thought to be regulated by temperature. This regulation blocks access to the ribosome binding site under normal conditions. During heat shock however, the structure changes freeing the ribosome binding site and allowing expression to occur [1,2]. This family includes predicted members of the family from gamma-proteobacteria.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -E 1000 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	14	31	0	0	Cis-reg; thermoregulator;	Published; PMID:16438677; Bateman A	42	0	\N		0.63393	-4.51852	1600000	223637	158	73	1	-3.75380	0.71895	2013-10-04 02:51:18	2019-01-04 15:01:52

There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localisation, stability and hyper-methylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 20.23 -Z 549862.597050 CM SEQDB	66	577	0	0	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Published; PMID:19875933	360	0	\N		0.64339	-9.13412	1600000	467174	724	276	1	-4.34560	0.70709	2013-10-04 02:51:41	2019-01-04 15:01:52

RF01854	Bacteria_large_SRP	1315	Bacterial large signal recognition particle RNA	Gardner PP	Published; PMID:19838050	60.00	60.00	59.90	The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA (RFAM:RF00017) and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most bacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) have a longer eukaryote-like SRP RNA that includes an Alu domain [2]. The Alu domain of the longer SRP RNAs is not included in this model and therefore the reported bounds of some members are incorrect. The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) [1] provides compilations of SRP components, with phylogenetic data and structural illustrations.

It is located within the p15/CDKN2B-p16/CDKN2A-p14/ARF gene cluster, in the antisense direction. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which alter the expression of CDKN2B-AS are associated with many diseases, including coronary artery disease, diabetes and many cancers [1]. It binds to chromobox 7 (CBX7) within the polycomb repressive complex 1 and to SUZ12, a component of polycomb repression complex 2 and through these interactions is involved in transciptional repression [2,3].

Orthologues exist only among other Pasteurellacae. It is an analog to PrrF and RyhB RNAs. HrrF is maximally expressed when iron levels are low. Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) binds upstream of the hrrF promoter. HrrF stability is not dependant on the RNA chaperone Hfq. RNA-seq has shown that that HrrF targets are mRNAs of genes whose products are involved in molybdate uptake, deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, and amino acid synthesis.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 30.00 -Z 549862.597050 --mxsize 128 CM SEQDB	7	13	0	0	Gene; sRNA;	Predicted; CMfinder	17	0	\N		0.50168	-8.66264	1600000	356755	340	116	1	-3.11540	0.71848	2017-03-14 16:52:58	2019-01-04 15:01:52

The 5' UTR has been predicted to contain 3 conserved stem-loops: SL1, SL2 and SL4. SL1 is important for viral replication, most likely playing a role in the template-switch of viral subgenomic RNA transcription. Mutations of the upper part of SL1 seems to have an higher impact of viral replication level. SL2 is crucial for viral viability, nucleotides are interchangeable as long as the structure remains stable. Disrupting any G-C pairing causes major defects in viral replication. SL4 is hypothesised to play a role in directing subgenomic RNA synthesis during viral replication. Downstream of SL4 lies SL5, which overlaps with the first ORF of the viral genome. The 3 terminal loops of SL5 contain a conserved sequence 5′-UUCCGU-3′ and are thought to act as the packaging signal [3].

A strong transcription start site for this RNA was experimentally confirmed, in the 3’ region of gene CD0749. The 3’ end of the sRNA has not been confirmed and its length was arbitrarily set to 100nt. For inclusion criteria: Only sequences from order Clostridiales were included, mostly because the starting sequence belonged to this order and the large majority of sequences found by the different RFAM search iterations belonged to this order as well. Associated e-values did not exceed 1e-09. As the original RNA is part of a coding sequence (CDS), it is possible that homologies were detected due to selection pressure for the CDS rather than for a sRNA. R-scape identified only two significantly covarying pairs present in the structure (4-100 and 7-97). Thus evidence for structure is weak.	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 30.00 -Z 742849.287494 CM SEQDB	24	38	0	0	Gene; sRNA;	Predicted; LocARNA;	56	0	\N		0.53030	-4.65586	1600000	272069	189	101	1	-3.72980	0.71845	2020-09-09 16:57:33	2020-09-14 14:07:43

During replication, a long-range RNA-RNA interaction between 5' UTR and 3' UTR of the genome is formed to initiate synthesis of new viral replicates and viral protein translation. In direct adjacency to the 5' UTR, already part of the coding region, lies the cHP structure, which is essential for the viral replication[3][4]. The first structural element is termed 5'SLA and comprises three stems (S1, S2, S3) folded as Y-shaped-like stem structure, and a side structure domain (SSD). Its overall length is around 70 nucleotides. Viral replication is stopped by disruption of S1 and S2. Further, via RNA-protein interaction with NS5, SLA serves as a promoter for RNA synthesis during circularization of the viral genome[5][6]. Despite the diversity of SSD, its stable structure is essential for infectivity[3]. The second structural element is termed 5'SLB. At its top region of the stem loop lies the translation initiation codon. It further contains the 5'UAR (upstream AUG region), which is essential for the circularization of the genome[8]. The 5'UAR interacts with the 3'UAR, which is located at the 3' UTR of the genome to form the long-range RNA-RNA interaction[8]. At the start of the coding region lies the capsid-coding hairpin region (cHP), which is followed by the 5'CS (conserved sequence). The 5'CS forms an additional long-range RNA-RNA interaction with the 3' UTR (3'CS)[5]. The cHP further aids in the start codon recognition and thus in viral replication. Studies show that the function of cHP is sequence-independent but structure-dependent[9].	\N	cmbuild -F CM SEED	cmcalibrate --mpi CM	cmsearch --cpu 4 --verbose --nohmmonly -T 30.00 -Z 742849.287494 CM SEQDB	8	1	0	0	Cis-reg;	Predicted; LocARNA 2.0.0RC8	1	0	\N		0.56466	-7.90607	1600000	264399	264	156	1	-3.04050	0.71786	2020-09-12 11:51:34	2020-09-14 13:57:30
